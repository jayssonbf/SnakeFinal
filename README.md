# Snake Game
In the game of _Snake_, the player uses the arrow keys or "WASD" keys on the keyboard to  move the "_snake_" around the board. As the _snake_ finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The _game_ ends when the _snake_ either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the _snake_ as large as possible before that happens.

In the following demonstration, you will see two different cases of how you can lose the game. The first animation shows the snake hitting one of the edges, and the second one shows when the snake collides with itself, which ends the game immediately.
